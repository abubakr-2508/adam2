Check browser permissions for camera access
Use HTTPS in production (required for camera access)
Try a different browser
Ensure camera is not being used by another application
OCR extraction issues
Ensure image is clear and well-lit
Check Llama API credentials in .env
Review logs for API errors
Try uploading instead of camera if quality is low
Database connection errors
Verify Supabase credentials in .env
Check table exists with correct schema
Review Supabase logs in dashboard
Test connection with /health endpoint
Form not auto-filling
Check browser console for JavaScript errors
Verify API is returning success response
Ensure JSON response format is correct
Check network tab in browser dev tools
Security Notes
‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Never commit your .env file to version control!

Use service role key only on server-side
Consider using anon key + RLS policies for production
Implement authentication before deploying
Add rate limiting for production use
Validate file types and sizes on server-side
Sanitize user inputs before database insertion
